Hello there!

This is an example application made to showcase a tiny little bit of my knowledge building fullstack applications with Ruby on Rails.

Also I used as an exercise for new feature in Rails 7, such as Hotwire/Turbo/Stimulus.

You can access a live version of this app on [Render](https://rails-fullstack-demo.onrender.com/).

To run this application locally:

```bash
docker compose up
```

This will spin up the web application, database and redis (for Hotwire and caching).
